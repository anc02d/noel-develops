## Milestone 1 Feedback

Directory structure and gitignore are perfect, as well as all html. Great job there.

Your Purpose presents a clear goal, along with very good descriptions and gives me a good idea of what the site is going to look like. You've created a perfect example of what the Purpose is supposed to be like. Great job.

Your Audience and Goals are also written very well - they explain who you're trying to communicate with in a very simple, easy to understand way, and I like your use of the ul tag in your goals.

The Persona you've described here gives me a very vivid picture of the employer, his needs, and the resources and technology he has available. I find it interesting that you go into so much detail about front end work and less pay - I'm assuming this is because you're more front end oriented, which is fine, but, in the future, don't rule out back-end positions as well. Also, don't sell yourself short as a junior developer and take low paying jobs just because they're the ones you've been offered right away. You have already shown the Bridge crew your high value as a developer. 

That being said, your Persona is written very well and gives me a good idea of what kind of position you're looking for. 

Great job on your Use Case as well - no edits needed there.

Normally I would put suggestions and needed edits down here, but honestly I couldn't find any in your site. Keep the lower pay and front end section written above in mind as you continue on your web development path, but overall you've done a fantastic job on your Milestone 1.

### You pass Milestone 1 in Tier IV. Keep up the good work with future milestones.
