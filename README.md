## Milestone 1 Feedback

Directory structure and gitignore are perfect, as well as all html. Great job there.

Your Purpose presents a clear goal, along with very good descriptions and gives me a good idea of what the site is going to look like. You've created a perfect example of what the Purpose is supposed to be like. Great job.

Your Audience and Goals are also written very well - they explain who you're trying to communicate with in a very simple, easy to understand way, and I like your use of the ul tag in your goals.

The Persona you've described here gives me a very vivid picture of the employer, his needs, and the resources and technology he has available. I find it interesting that you go into so much detail about front end work and less pay - I'm assuming this is because you're more front end oriented, which is fine, but, in the future, don't rule out back-end positions as well. Also, don't sell yourself short as a junior developer and take low paying jobs just because they're the ones you've been offered right away. You have already shown the Bridge crew your high value as a developer. 

That being said, your Persona is written very well and gives me a good idea of what kind of position you're looking for. 

Great job on your Use Case as well - no edits needed there.

Normally I would put suggestions and needed edits down here, but honestly I couldn't find any in your site. Keep the lower pay and front end section written above in mind as you continue on your web development path, but overall you've done a fantastic job on your Milestone 1.

### You pass Milestone 1 in Tier IV. Keep up the good work with future milestones.



## Milestone 2
Directory and HTML structure - Directory structure is perfect, as is your HTML. I'm very impressed with how well you did with the HTML, considering you had so much content. Fantastic job.

I like the plan for your opening page. The design is unique and image heavy, which I personally think is the best way to keep users interested. Look into some cool effects/filters for the images and text overlay so it's readable, but interesting. You could include some hover effects, for example. The only thing I'm confused about here is the way you worded your Content Strategy in relation to what you said in your "Opening Page" section. Your site does need to be single page, but you mention having a navigation bar on each page that the user goes to. Instead of other pages, have the navbar link to anchor tags so it scrolls down the page to specified sections. This is easy to do, and would improve the readability of your site because the user could quickly go to the exact section they want to view. This may be especially beneficial to you, because it looks like you want to include a lot of content. Think about how to do this but keep it aesthetically pleasing.

Development Portfolio - A development portfolio is a great thing to include on your site. Many students/companies do it, so you'll have lots of examples to follow. Try to make it unique and interesting, and, when you have more content to add, include many different styles of work that you've done. I would suggest including things you've done in this class, whether it's a link to your Plunkr, or a link to your Capstone, or any other future assignments, in order to fill up the content while you develop more things. 

You may want to consider using an image slider for this feature, especially on mobile. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

About me - I like the design you're planning to implement for this section. Having a lot of text is almost unavoidable on an "About me" section, so think about ways to split the text up and make it interesting to read.

Skillz - This is a fantastic idea! I often suggest to students that they include some form of showcase of the languages they are proficient in. There's many different ways to do this and keep it aesthetically pleasing, so think about that during development.

Contact is also perfect. No suggestions there. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/

Your CSS is nearly perfect, but you don't need to include the div. before the elements you're targeting. For example, phone as a class, will be called into css by simple using .class {}


### Fantastic job on Milestone 2a. You've passed in tier IV. Keep it up!
