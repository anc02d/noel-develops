		<h1>Personal Website Project:<br/>Milestone 2a Documentation</h1>
		<header>
			<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
			<p>My site will be one static page, and will consist of the following content: </p>
		</header>
		<div class="first">
			<h3>Opening Page</h3>
			<p>The first thing I want people to see is a well-thought-out (read: aesthetically pleasing and incredibly
				responsive) image frame with either my picture or a video (exact content tbd), overlaid with a
				"hello/welcome" message and my name. I would like it to be simple yet intriguing enough to make visitors
				scroll down. I am considering including a favorite quote. I'm going to do a fibonacci-inspired layout with
				all navigation links on the first page, as well as at the top of each page as the user scrolls.</p>
			<div class="desktop">
				<img src="../images/desktop/desktop_1_welcome.png" alt="Welcome"/>
				<div class="desc">Welcome Screen for a desktop. All gray boxes will be images with text overlay.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_1_top.png" alt="Phone Welcome"/>
				<div class="desc">Welcome Screen for a phone.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="second">
			<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>Since my purpose is to showcase my abilities as a Web Developer, the very next thing on this website will be
				my development portfolio, hopefully filled with lots of interesting and useful sites and apps I've created.
				I think a layout of images with clickable links will be ideal. The layout will keep the fibonnaci theme but
				I will need to fill in space with colors or images to make up for my current lack of portfolio items. In the
				phone layout, this won't be an issue, but I will need to come up with a strategy to prevent endless phone
				scrolling once I get more experience. </p>
			<div class="desktop">
				<img src="../images/desktop/desktop_2_portfolio.png" alt="Portfolio"/>
				<div class="desc">Portfolio screen on desktop.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_2_portfolio.png" alt="Phone Portfolio"/>
				<div class="desc">First Portfolio Screen for a phone.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_3_portfolio_b.png" alt="Phone Portfolio B"/>
				<div class="desc">Second Portfolio Screen for a phone.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="third">
			<h3>Third Scroll-point/About Me</h3>
			<p>Since people are still scrolling past the portfolio, I will include an "about me" section to highlight some
				of my professional and life experience and give readers a feel for my personality. The background image will
				be a photo I took of Albuquerque.</p>
			<div class="desktop">
				<img src="../images/desktop/desktop_3_about_me.png" alt="About Me"/>
				<div class="desc">About Me screen on desktop.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_5_about_me.png" alt="Phone About Me"/>
				<div class="desc">About Me Screen for a phone.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="fourth">
			<h3>Fourth Scroll-point/Skillz, yo</h3>
			<p>Next, I will display images or logos for the software, tool sets, and other skills I'm proficient in or have
				experience using, and probably add links to some certificates from Lynda, etc to show my dedication to
				learning.</p>
			<div class="desktop">
				<img src="../images/desktop/desktop_4_skills.png" alt="Skills"/>
				<div class="desc">Skills screen on desktop.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_6_skills.png" alt="Phone Skills"/>
				<div class="desc">Skills Screen for a phone.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="final">
			<h3>Final Scroll-point/Contact Me!</h3>
			<p>The next thing I'll include will be a footer with my contact information (showing under the skills section),
				including my email address, links to my linkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles, and a link to my
				downloadable resume. After scrolling past the footer, at the end of the page will be an embedded contact
				form so potential employers can reach me directly through the site.</p>
			<div class="desktop">
				<img src="../images/desktop/desktop_5_contact.png" alt="Contact"/>
				<div class="desc">Contact screen on desktop.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="phone">
				<img src="../images/phone/phone_7_contact.png" alt="Phone Contact"/>
				<div class="desc">Contact Screen for a phone.</div>
