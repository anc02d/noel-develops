		<h1>Personal Website Project: Milestone 2 Documentation</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>
			My content will be my development portfolio (hopefully filled with some interesting and useful projects), a list of the types of work I'm capable of and/or a skill set graph, my contact information, including my email, a business phone number, and links to linkedIn, Instagram, etc, and finally, some reviews from happy customers or employers saying how great of a person I am to work with. In addition to the links and contact info, there will be a contact form so viewers can directly reach me through the site. Other ideas include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>List of books I'm currently reading</li>
				<li>Photos or art projects I'm proud of</li>
				<li>Links to more personal sites/project, and/or my blog</li>
				<li>Photo of me</li>
				<li>Downloadable resume</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>Coming soon...</p>
