		<h1>Personal Website Project: Milestone 2 Documentation</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>Since my purpose is to showcase my abilities as a Web Developer, the main content on this website will be my development portfolio, hopefully filled with lots of interesting and useful sites and apps I've created. I will also list the software I'm comfortable with, the toolsets I have experience using, a visual representation of my skills in the form of a graph or chart, and maybe some certificates from Lynda, etc to show my dedication to learning.</p>

		<p>Of course I'll need to include my contact information, including my email, a business phone number, links to my linkedIn and Instagram profiles, and an embedded contact form so potential employers can reach me directly through the site.</p>

		<p>Finally, I'd love to add some reviews from happy customers, co-workers, instructors, or employers saying how great of a person I am to work with so that hiring authorities on the fence might be swayed to get in touch.</p>

		Other ideas I might include:
			<ul>
				<li>Downloadable resume</li>
				<li>Photo of me</li>
				<li>List of books I'm currently reading</li>
				<li>Photos or art projects I'm proud of</li>
				<li>Links to more personal sites/project, and/or my blog</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>Coming soon...</p>
